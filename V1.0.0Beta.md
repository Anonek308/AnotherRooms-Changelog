# In the new update we removed the smooth camera because it was causing a lot of bugs. A new monster (Blind) has been added and the map has been slightly enlarged (We're still working on it). We've also added a new main menu. It's all new. Time to fix bugs! So we removed the Xray Bug where we could see other rooms when jumping at the spawn point, and instead of the bug we added a small Easter Egg. That's all Thank you!
